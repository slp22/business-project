# Expanding Telehealth to Offest Costs of Missed Appointments 

## Client
* Who is your client and how will that client benefit from exploring this question or building this model/system?<br/>
    * Primary care practice, small, urban area, majority of patients are older or have comorbidities, 
    * Patients have a hard time getting around on public transportation alone to get to appointments and miss appointments. 
    * High rate of no-shows costs the practice revenue; patients do not get the care they need. 
## Question
* What is the question behind your analysis or model and what practical impact will your work have?<br/>
    * Does the upfront cost of telemedicine infrastructure offset the cost of no-shows for the small primary care practice?<br/>
* What data science opportunity and potential application do you see?<br/>
    * ???<br/>
* What is the purpose of the EDA you will do and the data science model you will propose?<br/>
    * Understand the factors that encourage patients to use telemedicine. <br/>
## Impact
* What impact are you trying to achieve? In other words, what will your work do for your client? <br/>
    * Reduce cost of no-shows by investing in telemedicine infrastructure.<br/>
* What is your impact hypothesis? <br/>
    * Investing in telemedicine will lower costs associated with no-shows and increase access to care for patients.<br/>
## Data Description
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? <br/>
    * [Medicare Telemedicine Snapshot](https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-type-reports/medicare-telemedicine-snapshot) Medicare beneficiaries who used telemedicine services between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021<br/>
    * [Getting started with telehealth](https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/getting-started/)
    * [List of Telehealth Services](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes)<br/>
    * [Patient Characteristics Associated With Telemedicine Access for Primary and Specialty Ambulatory Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774488)
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project?<br/>
    * One person with Medicare who used telemedicine services.<br/> 
* What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?<br/>
    * [Features](https://data.cms.gov/resources/medicare-telemedicine-snapshot-data-dictionary) of interest are: time frame, telemedicine service type, year, month, state/territory, medicare eligibility status, race/ethnicity, sex, age, rural/urban,, telemedicine users, telemedicine eligible users. <br/>
    
## Solution Path 
* What is your data science solution path? <br/>
    * ??? <br/>
* What other solution paths might be viable?  <br/>
    * ??? <br/> 
* How else could you accomplish your goals if not through data science? (Think practically; you might not even need advanced methods. If this is the case, make a justification for why advanced methods are the preferred solution path.) <br/>
    * Survey the current patient population about their interest in telehealth options if offered and learn more about the obstacles that lead patients to missing appointments.  <br/>

## Critera for Sucess
* What does success look like?  <br/>
    * ??? <br/>
* How specifically will you measure your results in order to determine whether your work is successful?  <br/>
    * ??? <br/>

## Assumptions and Risks
* Given what you’ve said about your desired impact and the solution(s) you will use to achieve it, what are some assumptions you’re making? <br/>
    * Patients are interested in telemedicine if offered. 
    * Patients may miss telehealth appointments. 
    * Patients have broadband access at home to attend telehealth video visits.
    * Physicians can assess patients via telemedicine as well as an in-person visit.
    * Physicians can request patients see them in person if they cannot assess their health well via telemedicine.
    * Patients still need to overcome challenges that contribute to missed appointments <br/>
* What are the risks to the approach you’ve identified? <br/>
    *    <br/>

## Tools
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?<br/>
    * Excel, Tableu <br/>
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?<br/>
    * None at this time.<br/>

## MVP Goal
* What would a minimum viable product (MVP)look like for this project?<br/>
    * Data comparisons ...<br/> 
    * One subset ...<br/>
    * One viz ...<br/>
