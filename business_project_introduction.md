Course Project Introduction
### Summary
Say that you'd like to do some data work for an organization, but they aren't hiring. They might not even know that they could benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you get their attention?

For this project, you are going to deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis to your target organization ("client") to try to get your foot in the door. Your job is to:

* Define a realistic business problem faced by your client
* Develop a fully-scoped proposal for how data science methods can be used to drive impact towards the defined problem, making use of the DS Applications and Opportunities lecture and scoping best practices covered in the lecture. At the very least, components should include:
  * Impact hypothesis
  * Solution paths
  * Measures of success, both technical and non-technical
  * Risks and assumptions

* Identify one or more publicly-accessible datasets relevant to your proposal and perform a preliminary analysis of the data, e.g. descriptive/exploratory analysis and visualizations. This analysis should explain the nature of your data and provide evidence that your proposed data science project is a feasible solution to the problem.
* Clearly outline the future data science steps that were not covered in your preliminary analysis
Communicate your proposal and preliminary findings in a 5-minute mock "pitch" presentation and in a short written description (more details below)

### Backstory
This is a fairly free-form project, and creativity is welcome. Be sure that there is enough time to do good work with the data, but it is fine to tinker with the premise of the project.

The client organization can be real or imaginary, a private company or a social sector group, anything you desire. The brainstorming examples document contains examples of clients and potential business problems, as well as other business questions to consider when brainstorming.

### Components
Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication -- that are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the project success guide.

#### Design
* The project should include a clearly defined backstory that satisfies a specific need for the client organization. It should be centered around a meaningful business problem that can be addressed with data science methods. The proposed project should be fully scoped out and then pitched during the slide presentation.
* All deliverable deadlines should be met, reflecting professionalism and effective scoping and workflow.
#### Data
* The data must be in tabular form, so that you can use spreadsheet tools and Tableau to access the data.
* Datasets should be reasonably large, e.g. over 1,000 rows and 10 columns. Consult with an instructor if you are considering deviating from this rule of thumb, which is often fine. However, data should not exceed 100,000 rows, because this much data will make it difficult for Excel to function properly. If your data source has more rows than that, you should take a random sample.
* You are welcome and encouraged to incorporate any additional, relevant data sources.
#### Algorithms
* Perform a thorough exploratory analysis in Excel and Tableau; clean, explore, aggregate, and visualize the data as appropriate to address the client's problem.
#### Tools
* Exploratory data analysis in Excel or Google Sheets is required.
* Visualization in Tableau is required. Note: As detailed in the Tableau lesson, Linux users will need to sign up for a free trial of Tableau Online. Please reach out to an instructor if you run into any issues with this requirement.
* Other tools not covered in the course are completely optional:
  * Acquisition tools could include web scraping libraries or use of APIs
  * Storage tools could include SQL or noSQL (e.g. MongoDB) databases
  * You may use Python for data acquisition if you wish (not required), but, otherwise please do your work in sheets and Tableau and do not use Python. Once you have completed significant work using sheets and Tableau, you can meet with an instructor, who can approve using Python for modeling and/or additional visualization.
#### Communication
* Students will deliver a 5-minute slide presentation at the end of the course to "pitch" their project and share the results of the preliminary analysis to the client. The target audience should be a person or team within the client organization who would be interested in this project. The presentation should be given in a compelling, clear manner and include effective visuals for communicating your objectives and findings.
* You will also submit a ~1-page written description summarizing your work: it should begin with a ~100-word abstract to be followed by a breakdown of your project along with the 5 major components.
### Deliverables
Please submit all project deliverables through Canvas.

For exact deliverable dates, refer to the main schedule.

For exact deliverable details, refer to the Metis Fundamentals project deliverable templates:

* Project proposal: short description shared with instructors
Additionally, students may meet with an instructor for a scoping meeting
* Minimum Viable Product (MVP) submission
* Written description, presentation slides PDF, Excel/Google Sheets Workbook, Tableau Workbook

  * Note: Students must submit Excel/Google Sheets workbook(s) containing their analyses, as well as Tableau workbook(s) containing project visualizations. Coding in Python/SQL is optional for this project, but should also be submitted if used.
  * See this sample format for a workbook-- raw data on one tab, cleaned data in another, a main summary page, a chart page, and other pages for other relevant analyses: Sample Workbook Setup_ Flex.xlsx
* Project presentation
